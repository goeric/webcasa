micasa stores everything in a single SQLite database file. This page covers
how data is stored and how to manage it.

## Database file

By default, the database lives in your platform's data directory:

| Platform | Default path |
|----------|-------------|
| Linux    | `~/.local/share/micasa/micasa.db` |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/micasa/micasa.db` |
| Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\micasa\micasa.db` |

See [Configuration]({{< ref "/reference/configuration" >}}) for how to customize the path.

The database path is shown in the tab row (right-aligned) so you always know
which file you're working with.

## Schema

micasa uses [GORM](https://gorm.io) for database access with automatic schema
migration. The database is created and migrated on startup -- you never need to
run migrations manually.

### Tables

| Table                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `house_profiles`       | Single row with your home's details |
| `projects`             | Home improvement projects |
| `project_types`        | Pre-seeded project categories |
| `quotes`               | Vendor quotes linked to projects |
| `vendors`              | Shared vendor records |
| `maintenance_items`    | Recurring maintenance tasks |
| `maintenance_categories` | Pre-seeded maintenance categories |
| `appliances`           | Physical equipment |
| `service_log_entries`  | Service history per maintenance item |
| `deletion_records`     | Audit trail for soft deletes/restores |

### Pre-seeded data

On first run, micasa seeds default **project types** (Renovation, Repair,
Landscaping, etc.) and **maintenance categories** (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical,
etc.). These are reference data used in select dropdowns.

## Backup

Your database is a single file. Back it up with `cp`:

```sh
cp "$(micasa --print-path)" ~/backups/micasa-$(date +%F).db
```

Since SQLite supports [hot
backup](https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html), you can safely copy the file
while micasa is running.

## Soft delete

micasa uses GORM's soft delete feature. When you delete an item, it sets a
`deleted_at` timestamp rather than removing the row. This means:

- Deleted items can be restored (press `d` on a deleted item in Edit mode)
- The `deletion_records` table tracks when items were deleted and restored
- Toggle `x` in Edit mode to show/hide deleted items
- Soft deletions persist across runs -- quit and reopen, and your deleted items
  are still hidden (but restorable). Nothing is ever permanently lost unless
  you edit the database file directly

## Portability

The database is a standard SQLite file. You can:

- Open it with any SQLite client (`sqlite3`, DB Browser for SQLite, etc.)
- Move it between machines by copying the file
- Query it directly with SQL if needed

The file uses a pure-Go SQLite driver (no CGO), so the binary has zero
native dependencies.

## Demo mode

`micasa --demo` creates an in-memory database populated with fictitious sample
data. To persist demo data, pass a file path:

```sh
micasa --demo /tmp/demo.db
```

Demo data includes sample addresses, phone numbers (all `555-xxxx`), and
`example.com` email addresses.
