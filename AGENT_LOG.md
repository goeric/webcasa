# Agent Log

## 2026-02-05 Session

**Context**: Previous agent left build broken due to field/method name collision in `logState` (both `matches` field and `matches` method). Fixed by renaming method to `matchLine` and field to `highlights`.

**State of remaining_work.md**: Multiple tasks listed. See git log for commit history from prior sessions. Working through remaining tasks sequentially.

**Work done this session** (see git log for details):
- Fixed build break: field/method name collision `matches` -> `matchLine`/`highlights`
- Regex match highlighting in log lines with `findHighlights` + `applyHighlights`
- Entry editing: Get/Update store methods, edit forms pre-populated, `e`/enter key, ctrl+s save, dirty indicator
- Layout overhaul: anchored status bar, tab underline, section spacing
- Dynamic logging: scrapped `-v` CLI flags, `l` toggles log pane, `L` cycles level (ERROR/INFO/DEBUG), always captures in background

## 2026-02-05 Session 2

**Work done** (see git log for details):
- Reworked log mode to three-level interaction: `l` enters log, `/` focuses filter, `esc` backs up one level
- Replaced `L` with `!` for level cycling to avoid keybinding confusion
- Added `logOff` level so logging can be fully disabled
- Added `--demo` flag with temp DB path and fictitious seed data (all 555 numbers, example.com)
- DB path shown right-aligned in status bar
- Replaced `deleted:on/off` with contextual `+ deleted` indicator
- Added `?` help overlay (centered full-screen, lists all keybindings by section)
- House profile form renders centered full-screen (no layout jank)
- Inline cell editing: left/right arrows move column cursor, `e` on non-ID column edits just that cell, `e` on ID opens full form
- Status bar shows contextual `e edit: FieldName`
- Rewrote entire palette to Wong colorblind-safe colors with `lipgloss.AdaptiveColor` for auto light/dark detection

**Codebase**: Bubbletea TUI for home project/maintenance management. Has house profile, projects, quotes, maintenance tabs with forms, search, and log pane. Data layer uses GORM+SQLite.

## 2026-02-06 Session

**Context**: User asked to review codebase for refactoring opportunities before starting remaining_work.md items.

**Work done** (see git log for details):
- Read entire codebase (15 Go files) and identified 6 refactoring opportunities
- Extracted `parseProjectFormData`, `parseQuoteFormData`, `parseMaintenanceFormData`, `parseApplianceFormData` -- each deduplicated submit/submitEdit pairs that shared 90% parsing code
- Extracted `projectFormValues`, `quoteFormValues`, `maintenanceFormValues`, `applianceFormValues` -- each deduplicated model-to-formdata conversion used by both full-form and inline-edit flows
- Extracted `openInlineEdit` helper -- deduplicated 7-line tail from all 4 inline edit functions
- Extracted `centerPanel` -- deduplicated `formFullScreen`/`helpFullScreen` centering logic
- Made `floatToString` delegate to `formatFloat` (was identical copy), removed unused `math` import
- All existing tests pass, build clean
- Redesigned house profile collapsed/expanded views (RW-HOUSE-UX): removed bordered chip boxes, replaced with middot-separated inline text; collapsed is now a single stats line, expanded uses section headers with indented continuation lines; removed `chip`, `sectionLine`, `renderHouseValue`, `HeaderChip` style, `surfaceDeep` color
- Used `ft²` instead of `sqft` in house profile labels
- Removed `db:` prefix from status bar path display
- Added `LEARNINGS.md` for cross-session notes (no-cd rule, colorblind/adaptive palette constraint)
- Fixed `/` keycap not rendering in status bar: `renderKeys("/")` was splitting on `/` as delimiter, producing empty parts; added bare `/` check
- Shortened status bar help labels: arrow symbols for left/right/up/down, `del`/`undo`/`col`/`nav` instead of longer words
- Replaced search/house labels with emoji (🔍/🏠), changed "edit all" to "edit"
- Moved `h` house toggle hint from status bar to house profile title line
- Replaced `+ deleted` indicator: keycap stays normal, only "deleted" label changes color when active
- Removed house emoji and "Profile" from title ("House Profile" → "House"), moved `p edit` hint into house title line (visible only when expanded), removed `p profile` from status bar
- Reverted search emoji back to text label "search"
- Added `ideating`, `delayed`, `abandoned` project statuses; introduced `cellStatus` cell kind with per-status color styling using Wong palette (rose/blue/orange/green/yellow/gray/vermillion); updated seed data with examples of all status types
- Refactoring pass #2:
  - `store.go`: collapsed 4 Delete + 4 Restore methods into `softDelete`/`restoreEntity` helpers (~-30 lines)
  - `view.go`/`model.go`: extracted `effectiveWidth()`/`effectiveHeight()` to replace 7 repeated width fallback blocks
  - `view.go`: extracted `filterNonBlank` helper, `joinNonEmpty` now delegates to `joinWithSeparator`, simplified `joinInline`/`joinVerticalNonEmpty`
  - `view.go`: extracted `withStatusMessage` to deduplicate status rendering in form/table branches of `statusView`
  - `forms.go`: inlined `floatToString` (was trivial wrapper around `formatFloat`)
  - `types.go`/`view.go`: replaced `tabLabel` switch with `TabKind.String()` method
- Merged house title + stats into a single line for collapsed view; same for expanded (title + identity on one line, sections below); removed now-unused `houseTitleLine` helper
- Right-aligned keystroke hints — reverted: moved H/P hints back to status bar, removed `houseLineWithTrailing` helper

## 2026-02-05 Session 3

**Context**: Previous agent partially implemented the Appliances tab work item but left the build broken. The data model, store CRUD methods, table column specs, row rendering, form data structs, form builders, and form submit methods were all done. What was missing: wiring into the app layer switch statements.

**Work done** (see git log for details):
- Fixed build: added `applianceOptions()` helper (returns `huh.Option[uint]` list with "(none)" sentinel)
- Added `inlineEditAppliance()` for per-cell editing (col mapping: 0=ID..8=Cost)
- Wired `tabAppliances` into all switch statements in `model.go`: `startAddForm`, `startEditForm`, `deleteSelected`, `restoreByTab`, `deletionEntityForTab`, `reloadTab`
- Wired `formAppliance` into `handleFormSubmit` in `forms.go`
- Added `tabAppliances` case to `tabLabel` (view.go), `tabIndex` (search.go)
- Added appliances to `buildSearchEntries` so they appear in global search
- All tests pass, build clean
- Cross-tab FK navigation: `navigateToLink()` + `selectedCell()` in model.go
- Header shows relation type (e.g. "m:1") via `LinkIndicator` style on linked columns
- Status bar `editHint` shows "follow m:1" when on a linked cell with a target
- Created PLANS.md for tracking feature plans across agent sessions
