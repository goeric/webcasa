## Resolving incidents

Incidents use soft delete as the resolution mechanism: deleting an incident
marks it resolved. The Incidents tab defaults to showing deleted (resolved)
items so you can see your full history. Resolved incidents appear with
strikethrough styling.

To restore a resolved incident, press `d` on it in Edit mode.

## Dashboard

Open incidents appear in the dashboard's "Open Incidents" section, ordered by
severity (urgent first). Press `enter` on a dashboard row to jump to that
incident in the table.

## Inline editing

All columns except `ID` and `Docs` support inline editing. Press `e` in Edit
mode on a cell to edit just that field.
