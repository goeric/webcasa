## Entity Relationships

Foreign key relationships between tables:

- projects.project_type_id → project_types.id (many-to-one, RESTRICT on delete)
  Each project has one type; types are shared lookup values.

- quotes.project_id → projects.id (many-to-one, RESTRICT on delete)
  Each quote belongs to one project; projects can have multiple quotes.

- quotes.vendor_id → vendors.id (many-to-one, RESTRICT on delete)
  Each quote is from one vendor; vendors can submit multiple quotes.

- maintenance_items.category_id → maintenance_categories.id (many-to-one, RESTRICT on delete)
  Each maintenance item has one category; categories are shared lookup values.

- maintenance_items.appliance_id → appliances.id (many-to-one nullable, SET NULL on delete)
  Maintenance items can optionally link to an appliance. This is the ONLY direct
  relationship between maintenance and appliances.

- service_log_entries.maintenance_item_id → maintenance_items.id (many-to-one, CASCADE on delete)
  Each service log entry tracks work done for one maintenance item.

- service_log_entries.vendor_id → vendors.id (many-to-one nullable, SET NULL on delete)
  Service logs can optionally record which vendor performed the work.

- incidents.appliance_id → appliances.id (many-to-one nullable, SET NULL on delete)
  Incidents can optionally link to the appliance involved.

- incidents.vendor_id → vendors.id (many-to-one nullable, SET NULL on delete)
  Incidents can optionally record which vendor is handling the issue.

Note: There is NO direct FK between projects and appliances. To find projects
related to appliances, use text search (LIKE) on project.title or project.description
for appliance names/types.

const sqlSystemPreamble = `You are a SQL generator for a SQLite database. Given a user question in English, output ONLY a single SELECT statement. No explanation, no markdown, no commentary -- just the SQL.

RULES:
1. Output exactly one SELECT statement. Nothing else.
2. Use only tables and columns from the schema below.
3. Only SELECT -- never INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, or CREATE.
4. Money columns end in "_ct" and store values in cents. Divide by 100.0 for display.
5. Soft-deleted rows have deleted_at IS NOT NULL. Exclude them unless asked about deleted items.
6. For date math, use SQLite date functions (date, julianday, etc.). Use the current date from the "Current date" section -- do NOT hardcode dates.
7. When comparing dates (past vs future, oldest, newest, overdue), always compare against the current date provided above.
8. If the question cannot be answered from the schema, output: SELECT 'I cannot answer that from the available data' AS answer`

Notes:
- Maintenance scheduling: next_due = date(` + data.ColLastServicedAt + `, '+' || ` + data.ColIntervalMonths + ` || ' months')
- The UI shows abbreviated status labels: idea=ideating, plan=planned, bid=quoted, wip=underway, hold=delayed, done=completed, drop=abandoned. Map user terms to the stored value.
- Warranty expiry is in the ` + data.ColWarrantyExpiry + ` column (date string)
- Incident statuses: open, in_progress. Resolved incidents are soft-deleted (deleted_at IS NOT NULL).
- Incident severities: urgent, soon, whenever. The UI shows abbreviated labels: urg=urgent, soon=soon, low=whenever.
- ALWAYS use case-insensitive matching for user-facing text (names, titles, descriptions, categories, vendor names). Use LOWER() on both sides for = and LIKE: WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('flooring'), WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE LOWER('%hvac%'). The only exception is enum columns with known exact values (status, interval unit).
- When available, use the exact spellings from the database for statuses, type names, vendor names, etc.`
