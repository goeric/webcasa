micasa is a [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
application following The Elm Architecture (TEA): Model, Update, View.

## Key design decisions

### TabHandler interface

Entity-specific operations (load, delete, add form, edit form, inline edit,
submit, snapshot, etc.) are encapsulated in the `TabHandler` interface.
Each entity type (projects, quotes, maintenance, appliances, vendors,
documents) implements this interface as a stateless struct.

This eliminates scattered `switch tab.Kind` dispatch. Adding a new entity type
means implementing one interface -- no shotgun surgery across the codebase.

Detail views (service log, appliance maintenance) also implement `TabHandler`,
so they get all the same capabilities (add, edit, delete, sort, undo) for
free.

### Modal key handling

micasa uses three modes: Nav, Edit, and Form. The key dispatch chain in
`Update()` is:

1. Window resize handling
2. `ctrl+q` always quits
3. `ctrl+c` cancels in-flight LLM operations
4. Chat chunk messages (streaming responses)
5. Help overlay intercepts `esc`/`?` when open
6. Chat overlay: absorbs all keys when open
7. Note preview overlay: any key dismisses
8. Calendar date picker: absorbs all keys when open
9. Column finder overlay: absorbs all keys when open
10. Inline input: absorbs keys when editing a cell
11. Form mode delegates to `huh` form library
12. Dashboard intercepts nav keys when visible
13. Common keys (shared by Nav and Edit)
14. Mode-specific keys

The `bubbles/table` widget has its own vim keybindings. In Edit mode, `d` and
`u` are stripped from the table's KeyMap so they can be used for delete/undo
without conflicting with half-page navigation.

### Effective tab

The `effectiveTab()` method returns the detail tab when a detail view is open,
or the main active tab otherwise. All interaction code uses this method, so
detail views work identically to top-level tabs.

### Cell-based rendering

Table cells carry type information (`cellKind`): text, money, date, status,
readonly, drill. The renderer uses this to apply per-kind styling (green
for money, colored for status, accent for drill). Sort comparators are
also kind-aware.

### Colorblind-safe palette

All colors use the Wong palette with `lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light, Dark}`
variants, so the UI works on both dark and light terminal backgrounds. Color
roles are defined in `styles.go`.

## Data flow

```
User keystroke
  -> tea.KeyMsg
  -> Model.Update()
  -> key dispatch (mode-aware)
  -> data mutation (Store CRUD)
  -> reloadAfterMutation() (refreshes effective tab, marks others stale)
  -> Model.View()
  -> rendered string to terminal
```

All data mutations go through the Store, which uses GORM for SQLite access.
After any mutation, `reloadAfterMutation()` refreshes the effective tab and
marks all other tabs as stale. Stale tabs are lazily reloaded when navigated
to. The dashboard is refreshed when it becomes visible.

## Overlays

Dashboard, help, calendar, column finder, and note preview are rendered as
overlays using
[bubbletea-overlay](https://github.com/rmhubbert/bubbletea-overlay). They
composite on top of the live table view with dimmed backgrounds. Overlays can
stack (e.g. help on top of dashboard).
