You are an expert go developer with even deeper expertise in terminal UI design.
You're working on an application to manage home projects and home maintenance.

It's very likely another instance of codex has been working and just run out of context.

If it doesn't exist add an AGENT_LOG.md to the repo.

If it does exist, add a new entry to the AGENT_LOG.md that records a compact
version of your thought processes and your actions avoiding duplication with
the git log (feel free to add an instruction like "look at the git log for
details" for that case).

Make the records maximally consumable by another instance of codex or another LLVM, trying to minimize token use but not insanely so.

Pause work at a good stopping point if it seems like token percentage is getting too high and things are slowing down.

**General development best practices**:
- at each point where you have the next stage of an MVP, pause and let me play around with things
- write exhaustive unit tests; make sure they don't poke into implementation
  details
- remember to add unit tests when you author new code
- commit when you reach logical stopping points; use conventional commits and
  include scopes
- make sure to run the appropriate testing and formatting commands when you
  need to (usually a logical stopping point)
- write the code as well factored and human readable as you possibly can
- always run go test with the -v argument to get the most information

Look at `remaining_work.md` and work through those tasks. When you complete a task, pause and wait for the developer's input before continuing on. Once allowed to move on, commit the current change set (fixing any pre-commit issues that show up).

When you finish a task, add a ## Completed section to remaining_work.md and move the task description to a bulleted list in that section with the short commit hash trailing the task like

- TASK_DESCRIPTION (SHORT-SHA)

and also note in the git log that addresses the task what the original task description was.

It's possible that remaining work has already been done, just leave those alone if you figure out that the task has already been done.
