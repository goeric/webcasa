The dashboard is an at-a-glance overview of what needs attention in your home.
It appears as a centered overlay on top of the normal table view.

## Opening the dashboard

- On launch (if you have a house profile), the dashboard opens automatically
- Press `D` in Normal mode to toggle it on/off
- Press `f` to dismiss it and switch to the next tab

## Sections

### Overdue

Maintenance items whose computed next-due date is in the past. Sorted by most
overdue first. Each row shows the item name, linked appliance (if any), how
many days overdue, and last serviced date.

### Upcoming

Maintenance items due within the next 30 days. Same columns as Overdue.

### Active Projects

Projects with status "underway" or "delayed." Shows title, status (color-coded
to match the table), and budget vs. actual cost. Over-budget projects are
highlighted.

### Expiring Soon

Two sources:

- **Appliance warranties** expiring within 90 days (or recently expired within
  30 days)
- **Insurance renewal** if it falls within the same window

Shows item name, expiry date, and days until/since expiry.

### Recent Activity

The last 5 service log entries across all maintenance items. Shows date,
maintenance item name, who performed it (Self or vendor), and cost.

### Spending (YTD)

Year-to-date spending summary: maintenance service costs + project actual
costs, with a total. Only shown if there's spending to report.

## Navigation

The dashboard supports keyboard navigation:

| Key     | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `j`/`k` | Move cursor down/up through items |
| `g`/`G` | Jump to first/last item |
| `enter` | Jump to the highlighted item's tab and row |
| `D`     | Close dashboard |
| `b`/`f` | Dismiss dashboard, switch tab |
| `?`     | Open help overlay (stacks on top of dashboard) |

When you press `enter`, the dashboard closes and navigates to the
corresponding row in the appropriate tab. For example, pressing `enter` on an
overdue maintenance item takes you to that row in the Maintenance tab.
