## How vendors are created

Vendors can be created in two ways:

1. **Directly** on the Vendors tab: enter Edit mode (`i`), press `a`
2. **Implicitly** when adding a quote or service log entry -- type a vendor
   name and micasa finds or creates the record

## Editing a vendor

Navigate to the Vendors tab, enter Edit mode (`i`), and press `e` on the
cell you want to change. Edits to a vendor's contact info propagate to all
quotes and service log entries that reference that vendor.

## Cross-tab navigation

The `Vendor` column on the Quotes tab is a live link (shown with `→` in the header). Press `enter` on
a vendor name in the Quotes table to jump to that vendor's row in the Vendors
tab.

## Drill columns

The `Quotes` and `Jobs` columns show how many quotes and service log entries
reference each vendor. In Nav mode, press `enter` to drill into a detail
view showing those records.

## Notes

The edit form includes a `Notes` textarea for free-text annotations about the
vendor. Notes are stored on the vendor record but don't appear as a table
column.

## Deletion

Vendors with active quotes or service log entries cannot be deleted -- remove
the referencing records first. Once a vendor has no active references, it can
be soft-deleted like any other entity.
