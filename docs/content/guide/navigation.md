micasa uses vim-style modal keybindings. There are three modes: **Normal**,
**Edit**, and **Form**.

## Normal mode

Normal mode is the default. The status bar shows a blue **NAV** badge. You
have full table navigation:

| Key         | Action               |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `j` / `k`   | Move row down / up   |
| `h` / `l`   | Move column left / right |
| `g` / `G`   | Jump to first / last row |
| `d` / `u`   | Half-page down / up  |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | Next / previous tab |
| `enter`     | Drilldown or follow link |
| `s` / `S`   | Sort column / clear sorts |
| `c` / `C`   | Hide column / show all |
| `H`         | Toggle house profile |
| `D`         | Toggle dashboard     |
| `i`         | Enter Edit mode      |
| `?`         | Help overlay         |
| `q`         | Quit                 |

## Edit mode

Press `i` from Normal mode to enter Edit mode. The status bar shows an orange
**EDIT** badge. Navigation still works (`j`/`k`/`h`/`l`/`g`/`G`), but `d`
and `u` are rebound from page navigation to data actions:

| Key   | Action                    |
|-------|---------------------------|
| `a`   | Add new entry             |
| `e`   | Edit cell or full row     |
| `d`   | Delete or restore item    |
| `x`   | Toggle show deleted items |
| `p`   | Edit house profile        |
| `u`   | Undo last edit            |
| `r`   | Redo undone edit          |
| `esc` | Return to Normal mode     |

> **Tip:** `ctrl+d` and `ctrl+u` still work for half-page navigation in Edit
> mode.

## Form mode

When you add or edit an entry, micasa opens a form. Use `tab` / `shift+tab`
to move between fields, type to fill them in.

| Key      | Action          |
|----------|-----------------|
| `ctrl+s` | Save and close  |
| `esc`    | Cancel          |
| `1`-`9`  | Jump to Nth option in select fields |

The form shows a dirty indicator when you've changed something. After saving
or canceling, you return to whichever mode you were in before (Normal or
Edit).

## Tabs

The main data lives in four tabs: **Projects**, **Quotes**, **Maintenance**,
and **Appliances**. Use `tab` / `shift+tab` to cycle between them. The active
tab is highlighted in the tab bar.

## Detail views

Some columns are drilldowns -- pressing `enter` on them opens a sub-table.
For example:

- **Log** column on the Maintenance tab opens the service log for that item
- **Maint** column on the Appliances tab opens maintenance items linked to
  that appliance

A breadcrumb bar replaces the tab bar while in a detail view (e.g.,
`Maintenance > HVAC filter replacement`). Press `esc` to close the detail
view and return to the parent tab.

## Foreign key links

Some columns reference entities in other tabs. These are indicated by a
relation label in the column header (e.g., `m:1`). When the cursor is on a
linked cell, the status bar shows `follow m:1`. Press `enter` to jump to the
referenced row in the target tab.

Examples:
- Quotes **Project** column links to the Projects tab
- Maintenance **Appliance** column links to the Appliances tab
