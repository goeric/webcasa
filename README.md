> Single SQLite file. No cloud. No account. No subscriptions.

- **What if we finally did the backyard?** Projects from napkin sketch to completion -- or graceful abandonment.
- **How much would it actually cost to...** Quotes side by side, vendor history, and the math you need to actually decide.
- **Is the dishwasher still under warranty?** Appliance tracking with purchase dates, warranty status, and maintenance history tied to each one.
- **Who did we use last time?** A vendor directory with contact info, quote history, and every job they've done for you.
