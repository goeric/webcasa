+++

Your house is quietly plotting to break while you sleep -- and you're dreaming
about redoing the kitchen. micasa tracks both from your terminal.

micasa is a keyboard-driven terminal UI for managing everything about your home:
maintenance schedules, projects, vendor quotes, appliances, warranties, and
service history. It stores all data in a single SQLite file on your machine.
No cloud. No account. No subscriptions.

## What it does

- **Maintenance tracking** with auto-computed due dates, service log history,
  and vendor records
- **Project management** from ideating through completion (or graceful
  abandonment), with budget tracking
- **Quote comparison** across vendors, with cost breakdowns
- **Appliance inventory** with warranty windows, purchase dates, and
  maintenance history tied to each one
- **Dashboard** showing overdue maintenance, active projects, expiring
  warranties, and YTD spending at a glance
- **Vim-style modal navigation** with Normal and Edit modes, multi-column
  sorting, column hiding, and cross-tab FK links

## What it doesn't do

micasa is not a smart home controller, a home automation platform, or a
property management SaaS. It's a personal tool for one house (yours), designed
to answer questions like "when did I last change the furnace filter?" and "is
the dishwasher still under warranty?"

## Quick start

```sh
go install github.com/cpcloud/micasa/cmd/micasa@latest
micasa --demo   # poke around with sample data
micasa          # start fresh with your own house
```
