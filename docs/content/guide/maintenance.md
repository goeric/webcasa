The Maintenance tab tracks recurring upkeep tasks -- things that need to happen
on a schedule to keep your house running.

## Adding a maintenance item

1. Switch to the Maintenance tab
2. Enter Edit mode (`i`), press `a`
3. Fill in the schedule form

The **Item** name is required. Set a **Category**, optionally link an
**Appliance**, and set the **Last serviced** date and **Interval months** to
enable auto-computed due dates.

## Fields

| Column    | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| ID        | Auto-assigned | Read-only |
| Item      | Task name | Required. E.g., "HVAC filter replacement" |
| Category  | Task type | Select from pre-seeded categories (HVAC, Plumbing, etc.) |
| Appliance | Linked appliance | Optional. Select from your appliances. Links to Appliances tab. |
| Last      | Last serviced date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Next      | Next due date | Auto-computed: Last + Interval. Read-only. |
| Every     | Interval | Shown as "N mo" (e.g., "6 mo") |
| Log       | Service log count | Drilldown -- press `enter` to open. |

## Next due date

The **Next** column is computed automatically from **Last serviced** +
**Interval months**. You don't edit it directly. If either Last or Interval is
empty, Next is blank.

Items that are overdue or coming due soon appear on the
[Dashboard]({{< ref "/guide/dashboard" >}}) with urgency indicators.

## Service log

Each maintenance item has a service log -- a history of when the work was
actually performed. The **Log** column shows the entry count.

To view the service log, navigate to the Log column in Normal mode and press
`enter`. This opens a detail view with its own table:

![Service log drilldown](/docs/images/service-log.png)

| Column       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| ID           | Auto-assigned |
| Date         | When the work was done (required) |
| Performed By | "Self" or a vendor name |
| Cost         | Dollar amount |
| Notes        | Free text |

The detail view supports all the same operations as a regular tab: add, edit,
delete, sort, undo. Press `esc` to close the detail view and return to the
Maintenance table.

### Vendors in service logs

The "Performed By" field is a select. The first option is always "Self
(homeowner)." All existing vendors appear as additional options. To add a new
vendor, create one via the Quotes form first -- vendors are shared across
quotes and service logs.

## Appliance link

When a maintenance item is linked to an appliance, the Appliance column shows
the appliance name. This column is a foreign key link -- in Normal mode, press
`enter` on it to jump to that appliance in the Appliances tab.
