## Status lifecycle

Projects move through these statuses. Each has a distinct color in the table:

- <span class="status-ideating">**ideating**</span> -- just an idea, not committed
- <span class="status-planned">**planned**</span> -- decided to do it, working out details
- <span class="status-quoted">**quoted**</span> -- have vendor quotes, comparing options
- <span class="status-underway">**underway**</span> -- work in progress
- <span class="status-delayed">**delayed**</span> -- stalled for some reason
- <span class="status-completed">**completed**</span> -- done
- <span class="status-abandoned">**abandoned**</span> -- decided not to do it

## Settled filter

In Nav mode on the Projects tab, press `t` to toggle hiding **settled
projects** (`completed` + `abandoned`). A `◀` triangle appears to the right of
the tab when the filter is active.

## Description

The edit form includes a `Description` textarea (in the "Timeline" group) for
longer notes about the project. The description is stored on the project record
but doesn't appear as a table column.

## Inline editing

In Edit mode, press `e` on any non-`ID` column to edit just that cell inline.
Press `e` on the `ID` column (or any read-only column) to open the full edit
form, which includes the description field.

## Linked quotes

The `Quotes` column shows how many quotes are linked to this project. In
Nav mode, press `enter` to drill into a detail view of those quotes.

On the Quotes tab, the `Project` column links back -- press `enter` to jump
to the project.
