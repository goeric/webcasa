The Quotes tab helps you compare vendor quotes for your projects.

![Quotes table](/docs/images/quotes.png)

## Prerequisites

You need at least one project before you can add a quote, since every quote
is linked to a project.

## Adding a quote

1. Switch to the Quotes tab
2. Enter Edit mode (`i`), press `a`
3. Select a project, enter vendor details, then cost breakdown

## Fields

| Column  | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| ID      | Auto-assigned | Read-only |
| Project | Linked project | Select. Shows as `m:1` link -- press `enter` to jump. |
| Vendor  | Vendor name | Required. Find-or-create: typing a name that exists reuses it. |
| Total   | Total quote amount | Required. Dollar amount. |
| Labor   | Labor portion | Optional. |
| Mat     | Materials portion | Optional. |
| Other   | Other costs | Optional. |
| Recv    | Date received | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Vendor management

When you add a quote, you enter a vendor name. If a vendor with that name
already exists, micasa links to the existing record. If not, it creates a new
one.

The vendor form also collects optional contact info: contact name, email,
phone, and website. These are stored on the vendor record and shared across
all quotes and service log entries for that vendor.

## Cost comparison

To compare quotes for a project, sort the Quotes tab by the Project column
(`s` on the Project column header) to group quotes by project. Then compare
the Total, Labor, Materials, and Other columns across vendors.

## Project link

The Project column is a foreign key. In Normal mode, press `enter` on the
Project cell to jump to the linked project in the Projects tab.
