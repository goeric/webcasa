# `micasa`

A terminal UI for tracking everything about your home. Single SQLite file. No cloud. No account. No subscriptions. Just your house.

Your house is quietly plotting to break while you sleep -- and you're dreaming about redoing the kitchen. `micasa` tracks both from your terminal.

## Features

- **When did I last change the furnace filter?** Maintenance schedules, auto-computed due dates, full service history.
- **What if we finally did the backyard?** Projects from napkin sketch to completion -- or graceful abandonment.
- **How much would it actually cost to...** Quotes, vendors, stare at the numbers, close the laptop, reopen the laptop.
- **Is the dishwasher still under warranty?** Appliance tracking with purchase dates, warranty windows, and linked maintenance.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/cpcloud/micasa/cmd/micasa@latest
```

Or grab a binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/cpcloud/micasa/releases/latest).

```sh
micasa --demo   # poke around with sample data
micasa          # start fresh with your own house
```

Your data stays yours. `~/.local/share/micasa/micasa.db`. One file. Back it up with `cp`.
